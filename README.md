# OpenSound for RC planes
Arduino RC Sound system first based on the work done by Mulder_den on RCGroups Forum: https://www.rcgroups.com/forums/showthread.php?2372161-RC-Sound-module-for-20

and TMRpcm library :https://github.com/TMRh20/TMRpcm/wiki

NB! The code is early in development at this point, not a working solution!
